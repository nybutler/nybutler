I'm Nyrique', a Computer Science student based in the United States.

I have worked on a variety of projects that use different languages - Python, Java, C, HTML, JavaScript and CSS amongst others here and there.

I use apps like Procreate, Photoshop and Illustrator when I am sketching ideas and working on visual elements.
